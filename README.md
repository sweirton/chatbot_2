# chatbot_2

Welcome to the new and improved chatbot! This chatbot is able to handle multiple user profiles and user sessions. It also has a configuration menu that enables users to convert and upload pdf documents.

Currently, there are two branches: one that talks directly to Open AI and the other uses LLama Index's subquery engine to talk with documents. The default branch, Open AI, has contextual memory.

Features that are in the works ->
- Enhanced user control over LM outputs (instructions/prompt template access, temperature slider, etc.)
- More profile options (change name, change api key, passwords/password changing, etc.)
- More intuitive/better looking UI

Future goals ->
- Hugging Face implementation
-- User ability to select choice model
-- Model training feature
  > Want to give the user an intuitive and user-friendly way to train their own models
- Website monitoring feature
  > This feature may be off-limits to the masses, but I want to include the ability to monitor websites for updates
